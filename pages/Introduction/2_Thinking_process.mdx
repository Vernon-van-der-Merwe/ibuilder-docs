## Technologies to use?
Since we dont want to have this test take forever 
and to provide you with my best work in the shortest time.
I have decided to go with technologies I feel comfortable with, but at the 
same time these technologies will be competators or very similar to the stack you use.

## Current system
- Front-end: React & Next.js
- Back-end: Typescript Lambda functions
- Database: CosmosDBs (NOSQL)

## My choice of technologies
- Front-end: React & Next.js
- Back-end: Typescript Firebase functions
- Database: Firestore DB (NOSQL)
